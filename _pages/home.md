## Overview
Data Science is redefining how people and organizations solve challenging problems and has become an essential skill for 
engineers in the 21st-century. This intermediate-level class bridges between APS106 (Fundamentals of Computer 
Programming) and CME263 (Probability Theory for Civil and Mineral Engineers) and upper-level machine learning, 
computer science and statistics courses. In this course, we explore key areas of Data Science including question 
formulation, data collection and cleaning, visualization, applied machine learning, and statistical inference. 
All lessons are taught with code and a strong emphasis is placed on the development of a solid foundation in 
programming. This course touches on a range of topics from visualization to machine learning which we believe serves 
to enhance the learning experience for students by allowing them to gain an appreciation for the close interplay 
between these topics. Although Data Science has gained visibility resulting from successful applications in marketing, 
e-commerce, and social media, it is becoming widely utilized for Civil and Mineral engineering applications. These 
applications include regulation and control of electrical grids, mineral exploration, traffic engineering, 
infrastructure health monitoring, deep mine hazard assessment, predictive maintenance, construction management, control 
and maintenance of water systems, and many others. This course aims to prepare Civil and Mineral Engineering students 
for this new reality.
