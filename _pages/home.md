## Overview
Data Science is redefining how people and organizations solve challenging problems and has become an essential skill for 
engineers in the 21st-century. This intermediate-level class bridges between APS106 (Fundamentals of Computer 
Programming) and CME263 (Probability Theory for Civil and Mineral Engineers) and upper-level machine learning, 
computer science and statistics courses. In this course, we explore key areas of Data Science including question 
formulation, data collection and cleaning, visualization, applied machine learning, and statistical inference. 
All lessons are taught with code and a strong emphasis is placed on the development of a solid foundation in 
programming. This course touches on a range of topics from visualization to machine learning which we believe serves 
to enhance the learning experience for students by allowing them to gain an appreciation for the close interplay 
between these topics. Although Data Science has gained visibility resulting from successful applications in marketing, 
e-commerce, and social media, it is becoming widely utilized for Civil and Mineral engineering applications. These 
applications include regulation and control of electrical grids, mineral exploration, traffic engineering, 
infrastructure health monitoring, deep mine hazard assessment, predictive maintenance, construction management, control 
and maintenance of water systems, and many others. This course aims to prepare Civil and Mineral Engineering students 
for this new reality.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will:
1.	Gain a high-level understanding of the various domains that make up the Data Science landscape including Data 
Analytics, Data Science, Data Engineering, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. This will include applications 
in both research and industry. 
2.	Develop an intermediate level of proficiency with Python and common Data Science libraries, such as Numpy, Pandas, 
Matplotlib, SciPy, Statsmodels, and Scikit-Learn. Additionally, students will be exposed to important coding best 
practices such as documentation, version control, logging, and project structure.
3.	Develop a solid grounding in core Data Science areas including data collection and cleaning, visualization, applied 
machine learning, and statistical inference. 
4.	Learn how to navigate through the Data Science lifecycle: Get Data, Clean Data, Analyze Data, Visualize Data, Answer 
Questions with Data, Predict with Data.
5.	Learn how to tell stories with data. It is not good enough to simply generate summary statistics and graphs. A Data 
Scientist must be able to use data to tell a story, which involves a structured approach for communicating data insights 
and involves a combination of three key elements: data, visuals, and narrative.
6.	Be prepared to enter upper-level courses in Statistics (ECE368 Probabilistic Reasoning, MIE1413: Statistical Models 
in Empirical Research), Machine Learning (MIE1516HS: Structured Learning and Inference, ECE1513H: Introduction to 
Machine Learning).), and Computer Science (ECE1762H Algorithms and Data Structures, ECE1747H Parallel Programming).
